#### Functional requirements
- When user opens the app, only the **Header** section should be shown
- After submitting the search form, the **Search results block** appears.
- Show cards of videos populated with mocked data (use data from [response example](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/tasks/angular/response.json) file). You can store the mocked data in the **Search results** component
  - The bottom border represents the publication date status. The following border colors should be used:
    - 🟥 if older than 6 months
    - 🟨 if between 1 and 6 months
    - 🟩 if between 7 days and 1 month
    - 🟦 if newer than 7 days
- By clicking the **Settings** button, the **Filtering criteria block** should be toggled on/off
  - It should be possible to sort search results by date or view count
  - Sorting should work in both ascending and descending directions of the values
  - Filter search results by the value that user types in the input
