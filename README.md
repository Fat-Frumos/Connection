## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

##  Check eslint .

#### Functional requirements
- When user opens the app, only the **Header** section should be shown
- After submitting the search form, the **Search results block** appears.
- Show cards of videos populated with mocked data (use data from [response example](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/tasks/angular/response.json) file). You can store the mocked data in the **Search results** component
  - The bottom border represents the publication date status. The following border colors should be used:
    - ðŸŸ¥ if older than 6 months
    - ðŸŸ¨ if between 1 and 6 months
    - ðŸŸ© if between 7 days and 1 month
    - ðŸŸ¦ if newer than 7 days
- By clicking the **Settings** button, the **Filtering criteria block** should be toggled on/off
  - It should be possible to sort search results by date or view count
  - Sorting should work in both ascending and descending directions of the values
  - Filter search results by the value that user types in the input

#### Functional requirements

- Global search functionality
  - remove the Search button. Now we're going to invoke the search logic once the user types something
  - in order not to spam our API, create a new Observable in your component and emit changes until the user enters at least 3 characters
  - add debounce functionality to prevent API calls from being performed if the user is still typing.

- Login block
  - create a new Observable in the Login service that will emit a boolean which indicates whether the user is logged in or not.
  - show the "Login" and "Logout" button if the user is logged out / logged in

- HTTP requests and YouTube API
  - remove the mocked response from your project and use a service that is created in the YouTube module.
  - use the HTTP interceptor to shorten request URLs in your services and pass your access token.
